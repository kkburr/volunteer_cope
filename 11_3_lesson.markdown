<h1>Introduction to Kodu</h1>

<p>This lesson is about making your first game on <a href="https://www.kodugamelab.com/about/">Kodu</a>. If you want to watch an example video on the possibilities within the Kodu framework <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZ5EVicSOU0">check this out</a>.</p>

<h2>First Game</h2>

<p>In Kodu, you can create a landscape, and then design how the player interacts with the landscape to win. For this first activity, students are creating a game where the default player has to touch each of the other characters in the land to win.</p>

<p>Have the student create some sort of a pattern in the landscape, then place 4-5 characters in a place of their choice (let's see some landscape creativity here). Note that this does not include the default player (s/he will have to interact with the additional characters).</p>

<ul>
<li>Each character in the landscape reacts (creates a creatable) when it is visited (bumped) by the main player</li>
<li>This bump changes a variable called Score W.</li>
<li>There is a designated home location where the player starts and ends the game</li>
<li>When Kodu is "home" and has "visited" all four (Score W equals number of landscape characters), the game ends with a win.</li>
</ul>

<p>If this sounds confusing to you and the student, play around with the interface together to understand how to add logic. For this first exposure, keep the logic simple but feel free to spend more time on creativity in the landscape.</p>
