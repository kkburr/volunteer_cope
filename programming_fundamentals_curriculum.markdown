<h1>Programming Lesson Ideas</h1>
<p>These are meant to be done away from a computer</p>
<p>Lesson 1: <a href="#booleans">data types: booleans</a></p>
<p>Lesson 2: <a href="#strings-and-numbers">data types: strings, numbers</a></p>
<p>Lesson 3: <a href="#if-else">what are: if/else conditionals</a></p>
<p>Lesson 4: <a href="#functions">what are: functions</a></p>
<p>Lesson 5: <a href="#arrays">data types: arrays</a></p>
<p>Lesson 6: <a href="#loops">what are: loops</a></p>
<p>Lesson 7: <a href="#hashes">data types: hashes</a></p>

<div id="booleans"><h2>Booleans</h2></div>
<ul>
  <li>Talk to student about scenarios where something is true verses false.</li>
  <li>Examples: you are a kid; I am a kid; my shirt is X color; you wear glasses; dinosaurs are extinct; dinosaurs are not extinct; etc.</li>
  <li>Use an example with a double negative in order to help.</li>
  <li>After going through examples, have the student come up with their own true and false examples</li>
</ul>

<div id="strings-and-numbers"><h2>Strings and Numbers</h2></div>
<ul>
  <li>When you say a sentence, like "I am going for a walk", in programming this is called a string. You use strings for lots of things, including to "print" notes for yourself to help you figure out what's going on.</li>
  <li>Numbers (like 4 or 2) are different than strings because you can do math with them. A string of a number (like "4") is different than the number 4 because you can'd add it with another number.</li>
  <li>Have the student write examples of a string and a number</li>
  <li>Revist booleans and equality as it relates to numbers/strings</li>
</ul>

<div id="if-else"><h2>If/Else Conditionals</h2></div>
<ul>
  <li>In programming, your goal is to build something or make something happen. For example, when I click or press enter on the screen I want something to happen.</li>
  <li>With if statements, you can tell the code to wait for something to happen, and when it does, do something new. </li>
  <li>Example: When you click the like button on Facebook, it will show that you liked it on the screen right above the button (or find an example relevent to them).</li>
  <li>Sometimes there are examples where you want to do something else based on the scenario (like choose your own adventure -- told old?)</li>
  <li>TODO: example of if/else</li>
</ul>
